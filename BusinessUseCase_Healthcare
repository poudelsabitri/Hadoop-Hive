Problem Statement
A healthcare organization processes vast amounts of medical records, patient visits, and prescription data. This data is used to analyze healthcare trends, such as:
1. Patient Visits by date and region.
2. Top Prescribed Drugs in different regions and time periods.
3. Patient Demographics analysis for targeted health programs.

Given the large scale of the dataset, querying the data for reports becomes slow without proper optimization. The organization wants to:
- Optimize queries to retrieve data based on visit date and region for reporting purposes.
- Speed up queries for specific prescription drug trends and patient demographics.
- Use partitioning and bucketing to manage the dataset efficiently in Hive, improving query performance and storage optimization.
Sample Data
Medical Visits Table (medical_visits)
Columns:
- visit_id: INT
- patient_id: INT
- region: STRING
- visit_date: DATE
- diagnosis: STRING
- treatment: STRING

Sample Data:
1, 101, North, 2023-09-01, Hypertension, Medication
2, 102, South, 2023-09-02, Diabetes, Insulin
3, 103, East, 2023-09-03, Flu, Antiviral
4, 104, North, 2023-09-04, Asthma, Inhaler
5, 105, South, 2023-09-05, Hypertension, Medication
Prescription Data Table (prescriptions)
Columns:
- prescription_id: INT
- visit_id: INT
- patient_age: INT
- patient_gender: STRING
- drug_name: STRING
- dosage: STRING
- region: STRING
- prescription_date: DATE

Sample Data:
1, 1, 45, Male, Lisinopril, 10mg, North, 2023-09-01
2, 2, 60, Female, Metformin, 500mg, South, 2023-09-02
3, 3, 25, Male, Tamiflu, 75mg, East, 2023-09-03
4, 4, 50, Female, Albuterol, 90mcg, North, 2023-09-04
5, 5, 70, Male, Lisinopril, 20mg, South, 2023-09-05


Solution-->
a. Patient Visits by Region and Date
To query patient visits for a specific region and date:
SELECT COUNT(visit_id) AS total_visits
FROM medical_visits
WHERE visit_date = '2023-09-01' AND region = 'North';
b. Top Prescribed Drugs by Region
To find the top prescribed drugs in a specific region:
SELECT drug_name, COUNT(drug_name) AS total_prescriptions
FROM prescriptions
WHERE region = 'North'
GROUP BY drug_name
ORDER BY total_prescriptions DESC;
c. Patient Demographic Analysis for Drug Prescriptions
To analyze the patient demographics for a specific drug, say Lisinopril:
SELECT patient_age, patient_gender, COUNT(drug_name) AS prescriptions
FROM prescriptions
WHERE drug_name = 'Lisinopril'
GROUP BY patient_age, patient_gender;



Description
Solution: Using Partitioning and Bucketing in Hive for Healthcare Data
1. Partitioning
Partition the data by visit_date and region. This allows the system to reduce the amount of data scanned when querying for specific dates or regions.
•	- Partition on: visit_date, region
2. Bucketing
Use bucketing on patient_age and drug_name. Bucketing will improve performance when querying for specific age groups or prescription drugs.
•	- Bucket on: patient_age, drug_name
3. Create Table with Partitioning and Bucketing
Hive Query to create the partitioned and bucketed table for medical visits and prescriptions:
CREATE TABLE medical_visits (
    visit_id INT,
    patient_id INT,
    diagnosis STRING,
    treatment STRING
)
PARTITIONED BY (visit_date STRING, region STRING)
CLUSTERED BY (diagnosis, patient_id) INTO 10 BUCKETS
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
STORED AS ORC;

CREATE TABLE prescriptions (
    prescription_id INT,
    visit_id INT,
    patient_age INT,
    patient_gender STRING,
    drug_name STRING,
    dosage STRING
)
PARTITIONED BY (prescription_date STRING, region STRING)
CLUSTERED BY (patient_age, drug_name) INTO 10 BUCKETS
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
STORED AS ORC;
4. Load Data into Partitioned and Bucketed Tables
When loading data, specify the partition values:
LOAD DATA INPATH '/path/to/medical_visits_2023-09-01_North.csv'
INTO TABLE medical_visits
PARTITION (visit_date='2023-09-01', region='North');

LOAD DATA INPATH '/path/to/prescriptions_2023-09-01_North.csv'
INTO TABLE prescriptions
PARTITION (prescription_date='2023-09-01', region='North');
6. Advantages of Partitioning and Bucketing
- **Partitioning**: Optimizes data retrieval for time-based and regional queries, reducing scan time for large datasets.
- **Bucketing**: Improves query performance for specific patient demographics and drug prescriptions by narrowing down the data scanned within partitions.
Conclusion
Partitioning and bucketing in Hive improve query performance by optimizing data storage and retrieval for healthcare data. Partitioning by visit_date and region helps speed up
